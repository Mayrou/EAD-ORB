# EAD-ORB

Official C++ implementation for the paper:  
**"EAD-ORB: Robust Feature Matching via Entropy-Guided Detection and Adaptive Description"** *(ZhiHeng Tang, Yan Dou, Xiaoya Wang, Lele Zhang)*

This repository contains the source code for the EAD-ORB feature matching algorithm, designed to overcome the limitations of standard ORB in challenging conditions such as drastic illumination changes and low-texture regions.

## Dataset

A quick comparison between standard ORB (Top) and our EAD-ORB (Bottom) on the challenging `leuven` sequence (severe illumination change).
